The team completed checkpoint 1/4 of the Formula E challenge and expressed enthusiasm to continue training on 06/08.

## KEY DECISIONS

1. **Training Schedule & Format**
   - Weekly training continuation decided (next session 06-08) instead of biweekly to accelerate executive preparation (case-by-case)
   - Meeting structure confirmed: 6:00-8:00pm format to mimic regular semester club meetings
   - Platform standardization: Zoom required for all training and club sessions (OSU premium access, Google Meet free limit is 1 hour for multiple participants)
   - Introduction protocol: 7-second structure (name, project/work, how to help others) adopted from Columbus Code & Coffee best practices ([https://cbuscodeandcoffee.com/](https://cbuscodeandcoffee.com/))
   - Mentor arrival protocol: early setup (before 6:00pm) for Zoom, food, and library room coordination
   - Pizza delivery strategy: schedule physically adjacent library rooms for single delivery location

2. **Club Meeting Operations**
   - Session structure:
     - 6:00-6:15pm: member arrival, food, drinks, settling
     - 6:15pm: 5-minute Google employee kickoff (livestream or recording)

   - Team dynamics: driver-backseat rotation every 30 minutes or per checkpoint completion
   - Mentor guidance approach: debugging assistance without handholding, prevent expensive mistakes

3. **Team Rotation & Content Strategy**
   - Team formation: two random variations maintained throughout semester for consistency (with rotation)
   - Challenge frequency: one challenge completed over two sessions (approximately monthly)
   - Summer specialization: each executive submits top 3+ preferences for specialized training with Keming
   - Mentor development: executives can become members at semester end for continuous learning

4. **Semester Planning Timeline**
   - Kickoff event: August 26th, 6:00-7:30pm Google collaboration (90-minute space reservation through OHI/O)
   - Space reservation challenge: 07/15 window for space booking vs 08/01 new club registration requires Cal King's assistance as OHI/O director
   - Random selection for members prioritizing commitment and availability post-kickoff
   - Meet Your Mentor session: September 2nd with project showcases, pizza, and relationship building
   - Cohort challenges begin following mentor introduction
   - End-of-semester graduation ceremony

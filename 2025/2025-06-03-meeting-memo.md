## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This meeting introduced the Buckeye Googlers executive team to advisor Cal King and focused on club registration, fall kickoff event planning with Google collaboration, and operational strategy. Key outcomes include postponing constitution review, establishing action items for club setup, and planning coordination with Google representatives for naming approval and event collaboration.

## KEY DECISIONS

1. **Club Registration & Operations**
   - Constitution review postponed; Keming to complete draft by June 8th
   - Club naming approval pending from Google via Nathan and Justin contacts
   - Alternative names prepared if "Buckeye Googlers" not approved
   - Discord server setup led by Ardi with roles and onboarding process
   - New student organization registration window opens August 1st
   - Membership selection strategy:
     - First cohort: random selection prioritizing high commitment and availability to focus on founding
     - Future cohorts: Yash and Aniket proposed rigorous selection processes (based on Buckeye Fintech experience)
     - Implementation: Keming postponed until more executive members available
   - Organizational independence:
     - Aniket and Yash questioned potential sub-organization status under OHI/O
     - Keming confirmed this is not Cal's intention and institutionally impossible
     - Result: Buckeye Googlers will maintain full autonomy while collaborating with OHI/O as mutual partners

2. **Student Involvement Fair Strategy**
   - Booth registration deadline July 1st precedes club registration window
   - Cal to investigate exemption for early booth registration
   - Alternative marketing strategies:
     - Share booth with OHI/O (Cal to check availability)

   - Alternative venue options:
     - CSE Department Open House collaboration (Joshua to contact CSE department)
     - HackOHI/O collaboration with Google as lead sponsor (Keming noted this requires significant Google investment in personnel, funding, and mid-semester timing may not align with Google's objectives)
     - Independent event if other collaborations not feasible
   - Target audience: 100+ attendees, primarily freshmen and sophomores
